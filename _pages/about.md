Currently a PhD student at [KAIST SIIT Lab](http://siit.kaist.ac.kr). 
My supervisor is Prof. [Junmo Kim](http://siit.kaist.ac.kr/Faculty) and I am also advised by Prof. [Yunho Jeon](https://effailab.hanbat.ac.kr/).
I am interested in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. 
My recent works involve continual learning and unlearning, noisy label learning, multi-modal contrastive learning, and scalable hyperparameter search.
Previously, I was a research intern at [LG AI Research](https://lgresearch.ai/) mentored by Dr. [Janghyeon Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hUpQRD4AAAAJ).
