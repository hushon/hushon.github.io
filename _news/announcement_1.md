In our new paper for [ICCV 2023](https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/), we explore machine unlearning in the context of transfer learning. We introduce a transfer learning strategy titled *Disposible Transfer Learning* (DTL). DTL filters out extra information during fine-tuning, which is useful for limiting the risk of exposing the pre-trained model when publishing the expert model. Our goal is to help continue open-source AI in the era of foundation models via striking a balance between transparency and security of ownership.
